# a-star-path-finding
A* Path Finding algorithm written in Python using PyGame
Astar Path Finding Visualizer
A Python program to implement and visualize A-star Path Finding Algorithm interactively.

About the Algorithm
A-star (also referred to as A*) is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes or graphs. It is an informed search algorithm, as it uses information about path cost and also uses heuristics to find the solution.

Running The code
A-star

Click on the blocks to place the start point/end point/walls

Press space to start the algorithm

Press c to clear all blocks

press left click to remove one block

The algorithm can run in one of two modes with Visualizer and without Visualizer

without Visualizer will find the path (blue line) without showing how it works and is almost instant
